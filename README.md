 # AgencyOS: A Computational Environment for AI Agents

AgencyOS is not an operating system for computer users, but rather a computational environment designed specifically for AI agents running on computing infrastructure. It's a Golang library and small wrapper around it - the server binary. The server acts as an orchestration platform providing agents with high-performance cached tools API, state of the art compute router, which supports routing requests to remote cloud GPUs, local GPUs, or even customer's own remote hardware.

## Features

- High-performance multi-agent execution environment for mixed compute
- A set of tools to facilitate Monte-Carlo search in semantic spaces with real-world grounding, for laptops

### Coming Soon:

- Plugins to support automated or user-controlled rent of servers
- Internal vector storage and RAG APIs
- Console user interface
- Image support (yes, even in console...)

Combined with LLM request caching, tracking, tagging, tracing, AgencyOS offers a powerful computational environment for AI agents.
